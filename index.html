      <p class="poem">
        Every film starts with something small — a click, a glance, a line.<br>
        Ours started with four words: ‘I miss you again.’<br>
        And the plot changed.
      </p>

      <p class="poem">
        They say a true star doesn't enter the frame.<br>
        The frame bends to her.<br>
        The light follows her.<br>
        And you realize...<br>
        she’s the one we’ll remember.

    <section class="star">
      <img src="images/scene3.jpg" class="scene-img" />
      <p class="poem">
        Some scenes make time freeze.<br>
        Ours?<br>
        You, me, food in the car. Rain hammering the glass.<br>
        No script. Just feeling.

    <section class="star">
      <img src="images/scene4.jpg" class="scene-img" />
      <p class="poem">
        She never needed a line.<br>
        Her eyes do the acting.<br>
        Her silence is the dialogue.<br>
        And still, I hear her louder than every soundtrack I’ve known.

    <section class="star">
      <img src="images/scene5.jpg" class="scene-img" />
      <p class="poem">
        She didn’t save the world.<br>
        She saved me.<br>
        With small things —<br>
        like staying, listening, forgiving.
      </p>

    <section class="star">
      <img src="images/scene6.jpg" class="scene-img" />
      <p class="poem">
        If the world watched her for one day —<br>
        they’d rise before the credits roll.<br>
        They’d cheer…<br>
        just because she existed.

      <p class="poem">
        Some stars fade.<br>
        But one…<br>
        waits quietly.<br>
        For June 5.<br><br>
